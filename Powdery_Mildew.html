    <p class="pbgh">" The Disease is Cherry Powdery Mildew "</p>
    <p class="pbgh2">'A serious disease of apples and ornamental crabapples, apple scab (Venturia inaequalis) attacks both leaves and fruit. The fungal disease forms pale yellow or olive-green spots on the upper surface of leaves. Dark, velvety spots may appear on the lower surface. Severely infected leaves become twisted and puckered and may drop early in the summer. '</p>

<div class="second">
    <h1 class="sh">Symptoms</h1>
    <ul class="uh">
        <li>The fungus attacks leaves and twigs, producing symptoms much like powdery mildew on apples. Infected leaves curl upward. Newly developed leaves on new shoot growth become progressively smaller, are generally pale, and are somewhat distorted. New shoots are shorter in length than normal. By mid-season, the whitish fungus can be seen growing over the leaves and shoots, sometimes in patches and other times covering most of the new growth. Such symptoms are especially common in nursery trees. The growth of sour cherry trees in the nursery and in young orchards is reduced by this disease.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Initial symptoms, often occurring 7 to 10 days after the onset of the first irrigation, are light roughly-circular, powdery looking patches on young, susceptible leaves (newly unfolded, and light green expanding leaves). Older leaves develop an age-related (ontogenic) resistance to powdery mildew and are naturally more resistant to infection than younger leaves. Look for early leaf infections on root suckers, the interior of the canopy or the crotch of the tree where humidity is high. In contrast to other fungi, powdery mildews do not need free water to germinate but germination and fungal growth are favored by high humidity (Grove & Boal, 1991a). The disease is more likely to initiate on the undersides (abaxial) of leaves (Fig. 2) but will occur on both sides at later stages. As the season progresses and infection is spread by wind, leaves may become distorted, curling upward. Severe infections may cause leaves to pucker and twist. Newly developed leaves on new shoots become progressively smaller, are often pale and may be distorted.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Early fruit infections are difficult to identify and you will need a hand lens to identify the start of fungal growth in the area where the stem connects to the fruit.
        </li>
    </ul>

<div class="third">
    <p class="th">Treatment</p>
    <ol class="ot">
        <p>Cultural Control</p>
        <li>Start looking for the first colonies about 1 week after the first irrigation.</li><br>
        <li>Remove and destroy sucker shoots.</li><br>
        <li>
            Keep irrigation water off developing fruit and leaves by using irrigation that does not wet the leaves. Also, keep irrigation sets as short as possible.
        </li><br>
        <li>
            Follow cultural practices that promote good air circulation, such as pruning, and moderate shoot growth through judicious nitrogen management.
        </li><br>
        <p>Chemical Control </p>
        <li>Begin at shuck fall and continue through harvest. Significant rain between budbreak and shuck fall warrants an application as soon as possible. Resistance to group 3, 11, and 19 fungicides has been detected in eastern Washington and may also occur in mid-Columbia areas. Resistance to group 7 fungicides is suspected. Alternate or tank-mix products from different groups that have different modes of action. Also, limit applications from any particular group to two (2) or fewer per year. Selection of products for rotation and/or mixing must consider group 7 fungicides when used through the irrigation as a nematicide. Do not use fungicides at risk of resistance curatively when high populations of powdery mildew are in the orchard. A temperature-based computer model can help time reapplications. Do not use products on long 21-day intervals.</li><br>
        <li>
