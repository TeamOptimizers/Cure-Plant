    <p class="pbgh">" The Disease is Late blight of potato "</p>
    <p class="pbgh2">' Late blight caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans is the most important disease of potato that can result into crop failures in a short period if appropriate control measures are not adopted. Losses in potato yield can go as high as 80% in epidemic years. During  past years, epidemics of the disease have appeared in 1985-86, 1989-90, 1992-93, 1997-98, 2006-07  and recently during 2007-08 season.</p>

    <h1 class="sh">Symptoms</h1><br>
    <ul class="uh">
        <p>On leaves:</p>
        <li>Small water-soaked spots develop at the tips, margins or any other part of the leaf which enlarge to form irregular dark brown lesions surrounded by a light green halo.</li>
        <br>
        <li>
            During morning hours, a whitish cottony growth of the fungus is visible around the dark brown lesions on the under surface of the leaves especially when weather remains sufficiently humid or when there is dew fall in the morning hours.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>If the weather turns dry, the lesions become necrotic and dry up.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Under favourable weather conditions (low temperature, high humidity due to intermittent winter rains) the disease spreads rapidly and whole of the crop may be killed within 10-14 days giving blighted appearance.</li>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>On Stem:</p>
        <br>
        <li>In case of infection originating from infected tubers, elongated brown stripes develop on the stem from below the ground level and encircle it.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The lesions also appear on the stem near the growing point when the inoculum of the fungus comes from the infected plants.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The infection can also start at nodes and extend both up and down the stem and the plant topples down under congenial weather conditions.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The infected portions of the stem bear white fungal growth especially visible in early morning hours but are not as prominent as on leaves.</li>
        <br>
        <p>On Tubers :</p>
        <br>
        <li>Infected tubers show irregular, shallow or sunken reddish brown patches. Inside infected tissue is spongy and rusty brown to varying depths. In sub-mountainous areas, the lesions on tubers are locally called "Pathar Dag". Later on, these lesions are often invaded by secondary pathogens especially in wet soils or in storage resulting into soft rot.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Smaller immature tubers are more prone to infection as compared to the larger ones and rotting is more in heavy wet soils.</li>
        <br><li>Late blight does not spread from tuber to tuber in cold stores.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Varieties with short stolons bearing tubers near to stem are more liable to tuber infection as in case of variety Kufri Chandramukhi.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>

    <p class="th">Treatment</p>
    <ul class="ot">
        <p>Effective control of this disease requires implementation of an integrated disease management approach. Late blight is a community disease, and effective management requires community management. Here are methods to help control the disease:</p>
        <br><br>
        <li>Destroy all cull and volunteer potatoes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Plant late blight-free seed tubers.</li>
        <br><li>
            Do not mix seed lots because cutting can transmit late blight.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Use a seed piece fungicide treatment labeled for control of late blight (current list of fungicides can be found in the NDSU “Fungicide Guide,” PP622). Recommended seed treatments include Revus, Reason and mancozeb.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Avoid planting problem areas that may remain wet for extended periods or may be difficult to spray (the center of the pivot, along powerlines and tree lines).
        </li>
        <br><li>Avoid excessive and/or nighttime irrigation.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Eliminate sources of inoculum such as hairy nightshade weed species and volunteer potatoes.</li>
        <br><li>Scout fields regularly, especially in low, wet areas, along tree lines, at the center of the pivot and other areas that remain wet for longer periods where late blight first may occur.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Use foliar fungicides on a regular and continuing schedule. Once late blight is present, only foliar fungicide applications can manage late blight in the field. (A current list of fungicides can be found in the NDSU “Fungicide Guide,” PP622).</li>
        <br>
        <li>Keep up to date on late blight forecasts. In our region, the NDSU Potato Blightline operates during the growing season and provides weekly late blight updates and forecasting.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Quickly destroy hot spots of late blight.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Kill vines completely two to three weeks before harvest.</li>
        <br><li>Applying phosphorous acid to potatoes after harvest and before piling can prevent infection and the spread of late blight in storage.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Monitor home garden and market tomatoes near you for late blight. Late blight can move from these local sources to potato fields.</li>
