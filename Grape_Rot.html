    <p class="pbgh">" The Disease is Grape Black Rot "</p>
    <p class="pbgh2">'Black rot, caused by the fungus Guignardia bidwellii, is a serious disease of cultivated and wild grapes. The disease is most destructive in warm, wet seasons. It attacks all green parts of the vine – leaves, shoots, leaf and fruit stems, tendrils, and fruit. The most damaging effect is to the fruit. Note: Guignardia bidwellii forma parthenocissi causes a leaf spot on Boston ivy and Virginia creeper. Control is as for black rot of grapes. <br><br>
     Warm, muggy weather in the spring and summer, along with unsprayed fruit of susceptible varieties, may cause fruit to become almost completely rotted by harvest time. Black rot is not difficult to control if good cultural practices are followed along with the use of protective fungicide sprays. '</p>

    <h1 class="sh">Symptoms</h1>
    <ul class="uh">
        <p><b>LEAVES :</b></p>
        <li>Reddish brown and circular to angular spots appear on the upper surface of the leaves starting in late spring. As spots merge, they form irregular, reddish brown blotches. The number of spots or lesions per leaf varies from 2 to more than 100 depending on the severity of the disease. The center of the leaf spot turns tannish brown and is surrounded by a black margin. Black, speck-sized fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are arranged in a definite ring just inside the margin of the lesion. Only young, rapidly growing leaves are affected.</li>
        <br>
        </ul>
        <ul class="uh"> 
            <p><b>LEAVES :</b></p>
        <li>
            Apple scab overwinters primarily in fallen leaves and in the soil. Disease development is favored by wet, cool weather that generally occurs in spring and early summer. Fungal spores are carried by wind, rain or splashing water from the ground to flowers, leaves or fruit. During damp or rainy periods, newly opening apple leaves are extremely susceptible to infection. The longer the leaves remain wet, the more severe the infection will be. Apple scab spreads rapidly between 55-75 degrees F.

    <ul class="ot">
        <li>BLACK ROT RESISTANCE :
            <ul>
                <li>All cultivated varieties (American, French Hybrid or vinifera) of grapes are susceptible to infection by the black rot fungus. However, over the growing season, berries become resistant to black rot infections. Concord is one of the first varieties to become resistant, while V. vinifera varieties are the latest to obtain resistance. Across the varieties, resistance occurs four to six weeks after bloom.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            CULTURAL PRACTICES :
            <ul>
                <li>For new grape plantings, select a sunny location that allows for good air movement. Orient rows with the prevailing winds to allow plants to dry quickly during wet weather.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            SANITATION :
            <ul>
                <li>Sanitation plays an important part in limiting the amount of black rot inoculum found in a vineyard. If only a few leaf lesions appear in the spring, these should be removed. The removal of diseased tendrils and canes through pruning during the dormant season will reduce the amount of spores available to cause infections in the spring. However, the removal of mummies either on the vineyard floor or remaining in the canopy, will have the largest impact in reducing black rot disease in the vineyard. Mummies in the canopy provide inoculum much later into the season than those that have fallen to the vineyard floor and thus should be given priority for removal. In small plantings, removal of diseased fruit when they are first observed is encouraged. Any mummies remaining in the canopy at the end of the season should be dropped to the ground and buried.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            CHEMICAL CONTROL :
            <ul>
                <li>Fungicides, applied early in the growing season, are a critical component of a black rot management program. The most effective spray program targets the period prior to bloom when spore production peaks. <b>Fungicides should be sprayed during the period from early bloom through three to four weeks after bloom.</b></li>
                <li>Commercial growers can consult the Midwest Fruit Pest Management Guide (Bulletin 506) and/or Developing An Effective Fungicide Spray Program for Wine Grapes in Ohio (Plant Pathology Series No. 147) for current fungicide recommendations.</li>
                <li>
                    Backyard growers are referred to Bulletin 780, Controlling Diseases and Insects in Home Fruit Plantings for fungicide recommendations. This publication and the Midwest Fruit Pest Management Guide (Bulletin 506) can both be obtained from your county Extension office or the CFAES Publications online bookstore at estore.osu-extension.org.
